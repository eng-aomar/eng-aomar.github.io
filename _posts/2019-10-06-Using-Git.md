title: Using Git for windows

### In this article I will talk about my own experience in using Git/GitHub for windows:

1. First you need to have an active account in GitHub.
2. For any repository you need to use (contribute) or just run it on your local machine, you need to take a copy to your repository.
2. Making copy of the source code from the original repository into your account repository is simply done by clicking on Fork button.
3. Once you click fork, a new repository will be added to your account with the same copy of the source copy.
5. To start using the code locally into your machine, you need to download a copy into your pc, this easily can be done in many ways, one way is using the Git Bash tool. you can [download Git Bash from here](https://git-scm.com/)
