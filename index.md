# Welcome to my portfolio
 
“To be successful, you must accept all challenges that come your way. You can't just accept the ones you like.” “Whenever you see a successful person, you only see the public glories, never the private sacrifices to reach them.” “The greatest glory in living lies not in never failing, but in rising every time we fail".

-David Viscott (Finding Your Strength in Difficult Times)
